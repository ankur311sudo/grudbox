🌿 Grudbox – A Grounded, Earth-Toned Theme for Omarchy

Grudbox is a calm, earth-inspired dark theme crafted for Omarchy on Arch + Hyprland.
It blends muted olive greens, warm shadows, and soft contrast to create a desktop that feels
focused, balanced, and deeply comfortable for long sessions.

Think of it as a quiet forest at dusk:
subtle, grounded, and restrained — where nothing screams for attention, yet everything feels intentional.

## Why Snow_Black?

Because not everyone wants a loud desktop.

Grudbox is for people who prefer calm over contrast, focus over flash, 
and consistency over customization overload. While many themes aim to impress instantly, 
Grudbox is designed to stay comfortable after hours of use.

It takes inspiration from Gruvbox’s warmth,
but softens the edges — toning down saturation, reducing visual noise, and creating a more grounded, natural feel.

If you:

work long hours in the terminal

prefer muted, earthy colors over neon highlights

want a theme that blends into your workflow instead of competing with it

…then Grudbox is made for you.
