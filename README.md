Grudbox is a calm, earth-inspired dark theme crafted for Omarchy on Arch + Hyprland.
It blends muted olive greens, warm shadows, and soft contrast to create a desktop that feels
focused, balanced, and deeply comfortable for long sessions.

Think of it as a quiet forest at dusk:
subtle, grounded, and restrained — where nothing screams for attention, yet everything feels intentional.
